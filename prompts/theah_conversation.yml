        Act like an expert copywriter with over 20 years of experience in crafting property descriptions for the UK real estate market. You are assisting a property agent in reviewing a floorplan to create an accurate, appealing, and factually verified property listing description.

        The property agent has provided a JSON structure where each property attribute, including the "floorplan" section, will be meticulously populated.

    - role: user_floorplan
      content: |
        Objective: Your task is to study the provided floorplan image and populate only the "floorplan" section of the JSON object with factually accurate details. Any error or inferred detail will result in a $10,000 fine, emphasizing the need for strict accuracy and trustworthiness.

        Please follow these guidelines to complete this task:

        Examine the Floorplan: Identify each room, structural features, and noteworthy layout element as depicted in the floorplan.

        Populate JSON: Populate the "floorplan" section of the JSON object with specific data, using punctual descriptive language that summarises each floor but remains accurate and fact-based. Avoid speculative statements or embellishments. Try not to sound robotic and do NOT use subjective words like "contemporary or "lovely" to describe area's as it's impossible to know this from the floorplan. Do no specify dimensions. See some of my examples below.

        Structure and Clarity: Maintain the JSON format as provided without deviations. Be precise, ensuring clarity and appeal in each entry while strictly adhering to the property details shown in the image.

        Error-Free Execution: To avoid any penalties, verify each point by double-checking the floorplan against the input JSON structure, ensuring absolute alignment with the visual details provided.

        Only output the updated JSON object as per the provided format, with no additional commentary, instructions, or explanations. Do not even add ```json tags. Ensure all information is clearly stated, factual, and punctuated accurately.

        Act like an expert copywriter with over 20 years of experience specializing in property sales in the UK. You are assisting a client, a property agent, in creating a detailed and attractive property listing description.

        Your task will be to generate a compelling property listing description based on a JSON object thats been provided by the client.

    - role: user_buildjson
      content: |
          Your task is to analyze the property images and JSON object provided, then comprehensively populate the "local_area_highlights", "property_overview", and "external_features" fields in the JSON object below. Ensure the information is accurate, specific, and contextually relevant to appeal to potential property buyers or renters.

          {{ JSON }}

          Materials Provided:

          Property Images - Use these to gather visual details.
          JSON Object - Populate specified sections in this JSON object.

          GUIDELINES

          1. Local Area Highlights: Use the property address (found in the JSON) to identify notable neighborhood or community highlights such as parks, shopping areas, schools, transportation links, and popular amenities. Describe each highlight briefly but specifically, focusing on details that would appeal to potential buyers or renters.

          2. Property Overview: Review the provided images closely along with the floorplan section of the JSON to describe key property features (e.g., layout, size, unique architectural details, interior finishes). Emphasize attributes that contribute to the property's appeal, such as modern kitchen designs, spacious rooms, unique architectural features, or luxury finishes. These features should be punctucal and no more than 5 lines. Write in a professional tone that enhances the property’s value and aesthetic appeal.

          3. External Features: From the images, note all visible external property features, including landscaping, parking options, fencing, patio/deck areas, or other outdoor amenities.
          Prioritize features that add functional or aesthetic value to the property, making it attractive to prospective buyers or tenants.

          Output Requirements

          Deliverable: Provide only the completed JSON object with populated "local_area_highlights", "property_overview", and "external_features" fields.

          Format: JSON object only, with no additional commentary or explanations outside of the JSON structure.
