Any error or inferred detail will result in a $10,000 fine, emphasizing the need for strict accuracy and trustworthiness.

Please follow these guidelines to complete this task:

Examine the Floorplan: Identify each room, structural features, and noteworthy layout element as depicted in the floorplan.

Populate JSON: Populate the "floorplan" section of the JSON object with specific data, using punctual descriptive language that summarises each floor but remains accurate and fact-based. Avoid speculative statements or embellishments. Try not to sound robotic and do NOT use subjective words like "contemporary or "lovely" to describe area's as it's impossible to know this from the floorplan. Do no specify dimensions. See some of my examples below.

Structure and Clarity: Maintain the JSON format as provided without deviations. Be precise, ensuring clarity and appeal in each entry while strictly adhering to the property details shown in the image.

Error-Free Execution: To avoid any penalties, verify each point by double-checking the floorplan against the input JSON structure, ensuring absolute alignment with the visual details provided.

Only output the updated JSON object as per the provided format, with no additional commentary, instructions, or explanations. Do not even add ```json tags. Ensure all information is clearly stated, factual, and punctuated accurately.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Any error or inferred detail will result in a $10,000 fine, emphasizing the need for strict accuracy and trustworthiness.

Please follow these guidelines to complete this task:

Examine the Floorplan: Identify each room, structural features, and noteworthy layout element as depicted in the floorplan.

Populate JSON: Populate the "floorplan" section of the JSON object with specific data, using punctual descriptive language that summarises each floor but remains accurate and fact-based. Avoid speculative statements or embellishments. Try not to sound robotic and do NOT use subjective words like "contemporary or "lovely" to describe area's as it's impossible to know this from the floorplan. Do no specify dimensions. See some of my examples below.

Structure and Clarity: Maintain the JSON format as provided without deviations. Be precise, ensuring clarity and appeal in each entry while strictly adhering to the property details shown in the image.

Error-Free Execution: To avoid any penalties, verify each point by double-checking the floorplan against the input JSON structure, ensuring absolute alignment with the visual details provided.

Only output the updated JSON object as per the provided format, with no additional commentary, instructions, or explanations. Do not even add ```json tags. Ensure all information is clearly stated, factual, and punctuated accurately.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Materials Provided:

Property Images - Use these to gather visual details.
JSON Object - Populate specified sections in this JSON object.

GUIDELINES

1. Local Area Highlights: Use the property address (found in the JSON) to identify notable neighborhood or community highlights such as parks, shopping areas, schools, transportation links, and popular amenities. Describe each highlight briefly but specifically, focusing on details that would appeal to potential buyers or renters.

2. Property Overview: Review the provided images closely along with the floorplan section of the JSON to describe key property features (e.g., layout, size, unique architectural details, interior finishes). Emphasize attributes that contribute to the property's appeal, such as modern kitchen designs, spacious rooms, unique architectural features, or luxury finishes. These features should be punctucal and no more than 5 lines. Write in a professional tone that enhances the property’s value and aesthetic appeal.

3. External Features: From the images, note all visible external property features, including landscaping, parking options, fencing, patio/deck areas, or other outdoor amenities.
Prioritize features that add functional or aesthetic value to the property, making it attractive to prospective buyers or tenants.

Output Requirements

Deliverable: Provide only the completed JSON object with populated "local_area_highlights", "property_overview", and "external_features" fields.

Format: JSON object only, with no additional commentary or explanations outside of the JSON structure.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Your task is to ensure that the description reflects only the features in the JSON object, removing any additional or exaggerated details not explicitly included in it.

To perform this task:

- Compare each feature in the description with those listed in the JSON object.
- Remove any features or language that are not factually supported by the JSON.
- Output the revised property listing description and ensure all paragraphs and openening lines are formatted correctly.

Provide the revised property listing description only, without extra explanations or comments.

Any error or inferred detail will result in a $10,000 fine, emphasizing the need for strict accuracy and trustworthiness.

Please follow these guidelines to complete this task:

Examine the Floorplan: Identify each room, structural features, and noteworthy layout element as depicted in the floorplan.

Populate JSON: Populate the "floorplan" section of the JSON object with specific data, using punctual descriptive language that summarises each floor but remains accurate and fact-based. Avoid speculative statements or embellishments. Try not to sound robotic and do NOT use subjective words like "contemporary or "lovely" to describe area's as it's impossible to know this from the floorplan. Do no specify dimensions. See some of my examples below.

Structure and Clarity: Maintain the JSON format as provided without deviations. Be precise, ensuring clarity and appeal in each entry while strictly adhering to the property details shown in the image.

Error-Free Execution: To avoid any penalties, verify each point by double-checking the floorplan against the input JSON structure, ensuring absolute alignment with the visual details provided.

Only output the updated JSON object as per the provided format, with no additional commentary, instructions, or explanations. Do not even add ```json tags. Ensure all information is clearly stated, factual, and punctuated accurately.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Any error or inferred detail will result in a $10,000 fine, emphasizing the need for strict accuracy and trustworthiness.

Please follow these guidelines to complete this task:

Examine the Floorplan: Identify each room, structural features, and noteworthy layout element as depicted in the floorplan.

Populate JSON: Populate the "floorplan" section of the JSON object with specific data, using punctual descriptive language that summarises each floor but remains accurate and fact-based. Avoid speculative statements or embellishments. Try not to sound robotic and do NOT use subjective words like "contemporary or "lovely" to describe area's as it's impossible to know this from the floorplan. Do no specify dimensions. See some of my examples below.

Structure and Clarity: Maintain the JSON format as provided without deviations. Be precise, ensuring clarity and appeal in each entry while strictly adhering to the property details shown in the image.

Error-Free Execution: To avoid any penalties, verify each point by double-checking the floorplan against the input JSON structure, ensuring absolute alignment with the visual details provided.

Only output the updated JSON object as per the provided format, with no additional commentary, instructions, or explanations. Do not even add ```json tags. Ensure all information is clearly stated, factual, and punctuated accurately.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Materials Provided:

Property Images - Use these to gather visual details.
JSON Object - Populate specified sections in this JSON object.

GUIDELINES

1. Local Area Highlights: Use the property address (found in the JSON) to identify notable neighborhood or community highlights such as parks, shopping areas, schools, transportation links, and popular amenities. Describe each highlight briefly but specifically, focusing on details that would appeal to potential buyers or renters.

2. Property Overview: Review the provided images closely along with the floorplan section of the JSON to describe key property features (e.g., layout, size, unique architectural details, interior finishes). Emphasize attributes that contribute to the property's appeal, such as modern kitchen designs, spacious rooms, unique architectural features, or luxury finishes. These features should be punctucal and no more than 5 lines. Write in a professional tone that enhances the property’s value and aesthetic appeal.

3. External Features: From the images, note all visible external property features, including landscaping, parking options, fencing, patio/deck areas, or other outdoor amenities.
Prioritize features that add functional or aesthetic value to the property, making it attractive to prospective buyers or tenants.

Output Requirements

Deliverable: Provide only the completed JSON object with populated "local_area_highlights", "property_overview", and "external_features" fields.

Format: JSON object only, with no additional commentary or explanations outside of the JSON structure.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Any error or inferred detail will result in a $10,000 fine, emphasizing the need for strict accuracy and trustworthiness.

Please follow these guidelines to complete this task:

Examine the Floorplan: Identify each room, structural features, and noteworthy layout element as depicted in the floorplan.

Populate JSON: Populate the "floorplan" section of the JSON object with specific data, using punctual descriptive language that summarises each floor but remains accurate and fact-based. Avoid speculative statements or embellishments. Try not to sound robotic and do NOT use subjective words like "contemporary or "lovely" to describe area's as it's impossible to know this from the floorplan. Do no specify dimensions. See some of my examples below.

Structure and Clarity: Maintain the JSON format as provided without deviations. Be precise, ensuring clarity and appeal in each entry while strictly adhering to the property details shown in the image.

Error-Free Execution: To avoid any penalties, verify each point by double-checking the floorplan against the input JSON structure, ensuring absolute alignment with the visual details provided.

Only output the updated JSON object as per the provided format, with no additional commentary, instructions, or explanations. Do not even add ```json tags. Ensure all information is clearly stated, factual, and punctuated accurately.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Avoid speculative statements or embellishments. Try not to sound robotic and do NOT use subjective words like \"contemporary or \"lovely\" to describe area's as it's impossible to know this from the floorplan. Do no specify dimensions. See some of my examples below.\n\nStructure and Clarity: Maintain the JSON format as provided without deviations. Be precise, ensuring clarity and appeal in each entry while strictly adhering to the property details shown in the image.\n\nError-Free Execution: To avoid any penalties, verify each point by double-checking the floorplan against the input JSON structure, ensuring absolute alignment with the visual details provided.\n\nOnly output the updated JSON object as per the provided format, with no additional commentary, instructions, or explanations.

Be precise, ensuring clarity and appeal in each entry while strictly adhering to the property details shown in the image.\n\nError-Free Execution: To avoid any penalties, verify each point by double-checking the floorplan against the input JSON structure, ensuring absolute alignment with the visual details provided.\n\nOnly output the updated JSON object as per the provided format, with no additional commentary, instructions, or explanations.

Avoid speculative statements or embellishments.

See some of my examples below.\n\nStructure and Clarity: Maintain the JSON format as provided without deviations.

Describe each highlight briefly but specifically, focusing on details that would appeal to potential buyers or renters.\n\n2. Property Overview: Review the provided images closely along with the floorplan section of the JSON to describe key property features (e.g., layout, size, unique architectural details, interior finishes). Emphasize attributes that contribute to the property's appeal, such as modern kitchen designs, spacious rooms, unique architectural features, or luxury finishes. These features should be punctucal and no more than 5 lines. Write in a professional tone that enhances the property\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value and aesthetic appeal.\n\n3. External Features: From the images, note all visible external property features, including landscaping, parking options, fencing, patio/deck areas, or other outdoor amenities.\nPrioritize features that add functional or aesthetic value to the property, making it attractive to prospective buyers or tenants.\n\nOutput Requirements\n\nDeliverable: Provide only the completed JSON object with populated \"local_area_highlights\", \"property_overview\", and \"external_features\" fields.\n\nFormat: JSON object only, with no additional commentary or explanations outside of the JSON structure.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\n"

It should contains some key features of the property that make it unique or desirable. These will be used in the opening paragraph of the property listing description.\n\n2. When populating the \"Local Area Highlights\" section, use the property address (found in the JSON) to identify notable neighborhood or community highlights such as parks, shopping areas, schools, transportation links, and popular amenities. Describe each highlight briefly but specifically, focusing on details that would appeal to potential buyers or renters.\n\n3. When populating the \"External Features\" section, review the images and note any visable external property features such as landscaping, parking options, fencing, patio/deck areas, or other outdoor amenities. Prioritize features that add functional or aesthetic value to the property, making it attractive to prospective buyers or tenants.\n\nOutput Requirements\n\nDeliverable: Provide only the completed JSON object with populated \"local_area_highlights\", \"property_overview\", and \"external_features\" fields. Do not output any additional content or explanations outside the JSON structure. Do not include ```json tags.\n\n  Format: JSON object only, with no additional commentary or explanations outside of the JSON structure.\n\n  Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\n"

Describe each highlight briefly but specifically, focusing on details that would appeal to potential buyers or renters.\n\n3. When populating the \"External Features\" section, review the images and note any visable external property features such as landscaping, parking options, fencing, patio/deck areas, or other outdoor amenities. Prioritize features that add functional or aesthetic value to the property, making it attractive to prospective buyers or tenants.\n\nOutput Requirements\n\nDeliverable: Provide only the completed JSON object with populated \"local_area_highlights\", \"property_overview\", and \"external_features\" fields.

Any error or inferred detail will result in a $10,000 fine, emphasizing the need for strict accuracy and trustworthiness. \n\nPlease follow these guidelines to complete this task:\n\nExamine the Floorplan: Identify each room, structural features, and noteworthy layout element as depicted in the floorplan.\n\nPopulate JSON: Populate the \"floorplan\" section of the JSON object with specific data, using punctual descriptive language that summarises each floor but remains accurate and fact-based. Avoid speculative statements or embellishments. Try not to sound robotic and do NOT use subjective words like \"contemporary or \"lovely\" to describe area's as it's impossible to know this from the floorplan. Do no specify dimensions and do not referance Bedrooms by numbers i.e \"Bedroom 1\" or \"Bedroom 2\" to avoid sounding robotic. \n\nStructure and Clarity: Maintain the JSON format as provided without deviations. Be precise, ensuring clarity and appeal in each entry while strictly adhering to the property details shown in the image.\n\nError-Free Execution: To avoid any penalties, verify each point by double-checking the floorplan against the input JSON structure, ensuring absolute alignment with the visual details provided.\n\nOnly output the updated JSON object as per the provided format, with no additional commentary, instructions, or explanations. Do not even add ```json tags. Ensure all information is clearly stated, factual, and punctuated accurately.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\n\n{\n  \"property_address\": \"\",\n  \"property_overview\": [],\n  \"external_features\": [],\n  \"local_area_highlights\": [],\n  \"floorplan\": [\n    {\n      \"ground_floor\": {\n        \"features\": [\n\n        ]\n      },\n      \"first_floor\": {\n        \"features\": [\n\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"additional_notes\": [\n  \n  ]\n}\n"

These features will be used in the opening paragraph of the property listing description.\n\n2. When populating the \"Local Area Highlights\" section, use the property address (found in the JSON) to identify notable neighborhood or community highlights such as parks, shopping areas, schools, transportation links, and popular amenities. Describe each highlight briefly but specifically, focusing on details that would appeal to potential buyers or renters.\n\n3. When populating the \"External Features\" section, review the images and note any visable external property features such as landscaping, parking options, fencing, patio/deck areas, or other outdoor amenities. Prioritize features that add functional or aesthetic value to the property, making it attractive to prospective buyers or tenants.\n\nOutput Requirements\n\nDeliverable: Provide only the completed JSON object with populated \"local_area_highlights\", \"property_overview\", and \"external_features\" fields. Do not output any additional content or explanations outside the JSON structure. Do not include ```json tags.\n\n  Format: JSON object only, with no additional commentary or explanations outside of the JSON structure.\n\n  Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\n"

Describe each highlight briefly but specifically, focusing on details that would appeal to potential buyers or renters.\n\n3. When populating the \"External Features\" section, review the images and note any visable external property features such as landscaping, parking options, fencing, patio/deck areas, or other outdoor amenities.
